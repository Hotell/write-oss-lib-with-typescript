## Environment setup

Before writting any code we have to prepare our environment.

Here is what you need to install:

- [NodeJS >= 6.x - LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/#)
- [npm 3.x](https://nodejs.org/en/#) - comes with NodeJS installed
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - download via installable or just `npm i -g yarn`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - comes with gitbash CLI ( useful for Windows < 10 or if you don't have [WSL on win 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) )
- TextEditor/IDE
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - install some of these [Plugins](https://github.com/Hotell/skate-starter/blob/master/.vscode/extensions.json)
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

We are going to write OSS library so we need to share it with the world somehow right?

We need create 2 accounts:

- [Github account](https://github.com/)
- [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/)
